Practical information
=====================

The SPIE Hack Day will be held on Thursday 26 June at the Palais des Congr√®s. It will run from 10:30, after the morning Plenary session, to the end of the day at 18:00.

The room will be decided closer to the date.

Registration
------------

You don't need to register for the Hack Day separately to attend; anyone attending the conference is welcome to join. If you're interested in the event we do ask you to fill in this form to send us your details so we can keep you updated closer to the time via email. This is not a formal commitment to attend on your part, and we won't use your details for any other purposes than to keep you informed on the 2014 Hack Day.

What to expect
--------------

Hack Days are not formal events. There is no agenda other than the start and finish times, no presentations, no formal talks.
Really, no agenda?

OK there is a very loose structure. We will start the Hack Day with a quick introduction, and invite people to pitch their ideas to the rest of the participants. This should take < 1 min per idea, no slides. Not all ideas will get worked on; that's ok.

At the end of the day we will have a wrap up, and ask people to show what they've worked on to the group.

I have a session at 14:00, can I still come?
--------------------------------------------

We know that it's a busy conference so we don't expect you to stay with us all day. We do ask that you come along at the start of the event at 10:30 to pitch your idea or listen to those of others, and be back at the end of the day to present what you've done.

Drinks and refreshments will be provided, so you won't need to leave the room for coffee!

We're big fans of open source and open collaborative development. We've created these page on GitHub where we can host individual repositories that you create, as well as the wiki pages for sharing ideas, tips and information. Anyone with a Github user account can edit these pages and list their repository here - but of course **you don't have to.**
