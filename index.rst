SPIE Hack Day 2014
==================

Welcome to the SPIE 2014 Hack Day Wiki!

What?
-----

A Hack Day hosted by `SPIE <http://www.spie.com>`_ at the bi-annual
`Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation <http://spie.org/x13662.xml>`_ 
conference.  The 2014 Conference is held at the Palais des Congres in
Montral, Canada, from 22 to 27 June.

What's A Hack Day?
------------------

`Hack Days <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon>`_ are open, informal, and
freeform events where anyone can come along for a day to create, or help create,
something new: a webpage, an application, a widget, a visualization, or even
a song or a video (if you're artistically inclined!).  You can come to share
your ideas, show something you've been working on, or learn new skills from
others.

What would I do there?
----------------------

The idea is not simply to continue working on whatever you do in your day job:
it's a chance to try something new, play with your code, data, pick up some tips
or skills from others.  Here, there shall be no Statments of Work, no 
Collaboration Agreements, no List of Deliverables, and no Design Reviews!

If you want, you can of course work with your existing collaborators on an 
existing project.  All we ask is that you show what you're working on, show 
what you've done at the end, and are open to work with other participants.

I'm not a software developer!
-----------------------------

Even if your job title doesn't mention "software", if you work in astronomy
and/or instrumentation, chances are you've written a few lines of code at some
point.  The Hack Day is not about finishing a software product, it's a chance
to experiment or lean something new.

And Hack Days don't just need people who code: if you're good with design,
visualization, or you simply have a great idea but not the technical skills,
come along!
